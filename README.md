# Fishing-addons
Fishing addons is an Hypixel skyblock addon that helps with fishing.
Getting Started
Installing Forge
Run normal Minecraft 1.8.9 and once it reaches the title screen wait about 5 seconds and close it.
Install Minecraft 1.8.9 forge from the forge website
Once you click on the installer you'd like to download, a window will pop up. Do not click on anything in the middle of your screen; instead, click on the skip ad button towards the top right
Open the installer, select install client, and click install
When forge is installed, open the Minecraft launcher, go under the installations tab, click new installation, select the version release 1.8.9-forge1.8.9-11.15.1.xxxx (it will usually be all the way towards the bottom).
Once you are done, run this new installation that you just created. Once it reaches the title screen, wait about 5 seconds and close it.
Installing the NotEnoughUpdates mod
Download the latest mod release. If it says this file may harm your computer, click allow anyways as all java files will be flagged by Chrome.
Add the Fishing addons mod:
If you have java installed, double click the file, click install
If not, press the windows key + R; type %appdata%; click on the folder called .minecraft; click on the folder called mods and drag the mods file in here.
Open the Minecraft launcher and run your forge installation you set up earlier.
Then, hop onto Skyblock and run the command /api new. Your api key is automatically filled out and all features should work.
Type /fa. If you see the fishing addons menu, you have done this correctly!
